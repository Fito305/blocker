// NOTE: 
// A Protobuffer - is used for encoding. it is a serialization protocol. 
// You can specify everything in a .proto file and the each language can compile that into a protobuffer format.
// Basically, in the block chain we have blocks. And a block consists out of a header, transaction and some
// other files. And the reason we have a header and a block is because, most of the time we don't want to 
// send everything over to notes, sometimes we only want to send headers for simple verification. And we also 
// do not want to hash the complete block. We only want to hash the header. It's a very common structure. It's 
// used in Bitcoin and a lot of other blockchain protocols. 

// What is the verions? It's the verion of the block. 
// The version of our serialization protocol. 
//It could be that we have some fields right now but later on that we add more fields,
// and people that are reading our blocks can check the headers and the version and
// if the version does not match they can say "we are not compatible with each other"
// and they can find another node that has the correct version.  Communicating the structure / version of 
// our blocks is important. important for backwards compatibility. The `height` of the block is basically,
// for example, if you have 10 blocks you are going to have a hieght of 10. bitcoin does not use the height. 
// It's basically, an ID but its the height or the index of the block.
// The previous hash of the block, of the preious block, is a chain because we are going to these hashes 
// and we are going to link them together. That is the core semantics of the blockchain. 
// The rootHash is going to be the root of our merkle tree of our transactions.
// timestamp is the time of when the block is created. 

// We need a way to compile this file, so we will add it in the Makefile. The proto/*.proto means
// that everything in the proto directory will be compiled.

// The UTXO transaction model in blockchain. The bitcoin blockchain uses UTXO model.
// A transaction is going to exist out of inputs and outputs. PrevTxHash is the hash of the previous transaction.
// The PrevOutIndex is actually the bigest index of the output of the that transaction. That we want to spend.

// The problem is that ht emoment we are going to sign a transaction we don't have a signature.
// TxInput. Because we are going to sign it to get our signature.


// NOTE: service Node {}, because in a GRPC enviroment you have this RPC protocol, but we need to have some kind of 
// boradcasting mechanism because if somebody is sending a transaction we need to boradcast that transaction to all
// all known nodes / servers, in the network. And we need to do some extra stuff to make it work.
